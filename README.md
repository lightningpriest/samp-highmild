# High Mild Roleplay
This is SA-MP Roleplay Script that I worked on development between 2020-2021 with help from [LuminouZ307](https://github.com/LuminouZ307/).  
Many unique systems have been added, You can check them closely from the script or test it in-game.  
At first, this project was named **High Mild** then evolved to **Project Two** because our team was disbanded.  
  
## Notes
- This gamemode was not 100% completed.
- You can find some bugs that still exist in the script.
  
## Includes
From now, I've added the server requirements. You can easily download it from [here](https://github.com/rizzyneck/samp-highmild/blob/main/Requirements.zip).
